## Abstract

Feedback control in classical systems is an indispensable, ubiquitous tool.  The theoretical basis for achieving optimal classical control is well understood, and crucially relies on a very classical assumption: that measurements of the state of a system under control need not perturb that state.  In a quantum context this assumption is fundamentally invalid.  Although many aspects of the theory of quantum feedback control are relatively well developed, the technological basis for feedback control of a single quantum system has only very recently matured.  We demonstrate the experimental realization of a quantum feedback control protocol, perpetually stabilizing the coherent Rabi oscillations of a superconducting qubit.  This is the first utilization of quantum feedback control for stabilizing a dynamical process, and the first application of quantum feedback in a solid-state system of any kind.  This demonstration comprises the first half of this thesis.  The feedback protocol is predicated on the ability to make high-fidelity quantum measurements, which are enabled by quantum-limited Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPAs).  The design and realization of the novel Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier (JTWPA) comprises the second half of this thesis.  The JTWPA achieves order-of-magnitude improvements over state of the art JPAs in bandwidth and signal power handling while providing quantum-limited noise performance, potentially enabling the simultaneous readout of dozens of superconducting qubits and the generation of broadband multi-mode squeezing in the microwave domain.
